This is the FORM library used in my Master's project. It is used for the calculation of
flavour-ordered amplitudes in the non-linear sigma model.

I have uploaded it for reference and in the hope that it is useful to anyone who wishes
to use my methods. It is rather ad-hoc in some places, and contains many deprecated
parts. Use with caution, and read the documentation provided in the .prc files.

The easiest way to calculate amplitudes is to run fodge (see separate repository) with
the -f option enabled. This will generate a set of .hf files containing the information
needed for FORM to compute the amplitude. These are used by running run_fordge.prc.

Alternatively, one can calculate using hand-written diagrams, which was done when
developing this library before fodge existed.

The files named foMXpY.frm are used to compute the X-point O(p^Y) amplitude using
flavour-ordering. They are left as-is, and therefore contain various modes of post-
processing. Nevertheless, they serve as a good reference for how to use the library,
and most of them work "out of the box".

The files named MXpY.frm are used to perform the same computations but without
flavour-ordering. This is slower, but is used to verify that the flavour-ordering
works as intended. They are written in a more old-fashioned way, with one diagram
per file (MXpYa.frm, MXpYb.frm, etc), then a summing file (MXpYall.frm) and finally
a post-processing file (MXpY.frm).
